        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Macaroni is a type of dry pasta shaped like small tubes, most commonly found in a curved, elbow-like form. Made primarily from durum wheat and water, it's a staple in many kitchens due to its quick cooking time and ability to pair well with a variety of sauces. Macaroni is especially popular in Western cuisine, where it's often used in comfort food dishes like macaroni and cheese or pasta salads.</p>

        <p>Beyond just mac and cheese, macaroni is incredibly versatile. It can be baked into casseroles, added to soups, or tossed with vegetables and proteins for a quick meal. Its tubular shape helps hold sauces, making it ideal for creamy, cheesy, or tomato-based dishes. While it's simple and humble, macaroni remains a classic that adapts well to different flavors and styles of cooking.</p>
