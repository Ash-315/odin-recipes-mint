        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ramen is a beloved Japanese noodle soup dish that has gained worldwide popularity for its comforting flavors and rich, savory broths. Traditionally, it consists of wheat noodles served in a broth made from meat, fish, or vegetables, and is often topped with ingredients like sliced pork (chashu), soft-boiled eggs, green onions, and seaweed. Each region in Japan has its own twist—like the miso-based ramen of Hokkaido or the tonkotsu (pork bone) ramen of Fukuoka—making ramen a versatile and deeply cultural experience.</p>

        <p>Beyond traditional styles, ramen has also evolved globally, inspiring creative variations and instant versions that cater to fast-paced lifestyles. From gourmet ramen bars to instant cup noodles, its accessibility and depth of flavor make it a favorite comfort food. Whether you're slurping up a bowl at a bustling Tokyo shop or cooking it at home with your own toppings, ramen offers a delicious blend of tradition and modernity.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Broth</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth (or a mix of chicken and pork broth)</li>
            <li>2 cups dashi stock (or water with dashi powder)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon mirin (sweet rice wine)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sake</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic (smashed)</li>
            <li>1 small piece of ginger (sliced)</li>
            <li>Optional: a bit of sesame oil or chili oil for extra depth</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Noodles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups (240g) of wheat flour (all-purpose or bread flour)</li>
            <li>1 tsp of kansui (alkaline water), or 1/2 tsp of baking soda mixed with 1/4 cup water if you can't find kansui</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) of water</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of salt (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the pork bones under cold water to remove any impurities. If you're using chicken bones, you can skip the rinse, but blanch them in boiling water for about 5 minutes, then discard the water to remove excess impurities.</li>
            <li>Place the bones in a large pot and cover them with 10 cups of cold water. Bring it to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Skim off any scum or impurities that rise to the surface. Continue simmering on low heat for 4-6 hours, uncovered, skimming occasionally.</li>
            <li>After about 30 minutes of simmering, add the ginger, garlic, onion, and scallions (save some scallions for garnish).</li>
            <li>If you're using kombu, dried shiitake mushrooms, or dried sardines for extra umami, add them about 1 hour before finishing.</li>
            <li>Add more water if needed to maintain the broth level throughout the simmering.</li>
            <li>After the broth has become rich and flavorful, strain out the bones and aromatics using a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth.</li>
            <li>Season the broth with soy sauce and salt to taste. If making shio ramen, add more salt; for shoyu or miso, adjust the soy sauce accordingly.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of wheat flour and 1/2 tsp of salt.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix 1 tsp of kansui (or a baking soda solution) with 1/2 cup of water.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour this liquid mixture into the flour while stirring, until the dough starts to come together.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a clean surface for about 10 minutes, until it’s smooth and elastic. If the dough feels too dry, add water 1 tsp at a time; if it's too wet, add more flour.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>After resting, roll the dough out as thin as you can using a rolling pin or pasta machine.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is about 1/8 inch thick, cut it into thin strands.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles for 2-4 minutes, depending on their thickness.</li>
            <li>Once the noodles are done, drain them and rinse briefly under cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
            <li>Place the cooked noodles in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour the hot broth over the noodles.</li>
            <li>Top with your choice of toppings like a soft-boiled marinated egg, sliced chashu pork, nori, menma, and sliced scallions.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
