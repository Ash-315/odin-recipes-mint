        <h1>Mandi Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../images/mandi.jpg" alt="Mandi">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mandi is a traditional Arabian dish that originates from Yemen and is especially popular in the southern regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It is typically made with rice, meat (commonly lamb or chicken), and a blend of aromatic spices including cardamom, cloves, and black lime. What sets mandi apart is the unique cooking method: the meat is traditionally slow-cooked in a tandoor (underground clay oven), which infuses it with a smoky flavor and ensures a tender texture that falls off the bone.</p>
        <p>The rice in mandi is cooked separately in the meat’s broth, absorbing the rich flavors and spices. Often garnished with fried onions, raisins, or nuts, the dish is both hearty and fragrant. Mandi is commonly served at large gatherings or special occasions and is typically enjoyed communally, with diners sharing from a large platter. Its deep cultural roots and mouthwatering flavor have helped it spread far beyond Yemen, becoming a staple in many Middle Eastern restaurants around the world.</p>
